# service24 online service provider

## Setup

##### Dependencies

> Prerequisites

- Python 3.8.5
- Django 3.0.5
- MongoDB 4.0.14

The following steps will walk you thru installation on a Mac. I think linux should be similar. It's also possible to develop
on a Windows machine, but I have not documented the steps. If you've developed django apps on Windows, you should have little problem getting up and running.

###### On Mac

First you will install mongo in your system.

```
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@4.0
mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork
ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod
```

Create the database by running the following commands in a mongo shell

```angular2html
mongo
use service24
```

### Setup Django Server (Mac)

We're using python3 instead of python2.x. If you don't have python3 installed,
install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), thenâ€¦

```
brew install python3
```

Assuming you've cloned the repository, open Terminal and `cd ~/your/path/to/service24`.

```bash/zsh
cd clone https://github.com/mbrsagor/service24.git
cd service24
virtualenv venv --python=python3.8
```

Activate it:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

###### Then create ``.env`` file and paste code from `.env-sample` file and add validate information.

-------------------------------------------
```bash
|--> .env-sample
|--> .env

Install the python dependencies which includes django and other libraries.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run server locally

```
./manage.py makemigrations user
./manage.py migrate user
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py runserver
```
